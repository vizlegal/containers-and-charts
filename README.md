Sometime we need to create our own containers or charts to have a more updated version or simply becuase we prefer to deploy it in a different way.

We will make some of this public available in case someone else want to save some hours of work but remeber it is as-is with not guarantee or responsability for Vizlegal.

You can find `README's` with specific instructions in each directory.

PR's are welcome :)

## Helm charts repository

    helm repo add vl https://vizlegal.github.io/containers-and-charts/
