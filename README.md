Sometimes we need to create our own containers or charts to have a more updated version, or simply because we prefer to deploy it differently.

We will make some of this public available in case someone else want to save some hours of work, but remember it is as-is with not guarantee or responsibility for Vizlegal.

You can find `README's` with specific instructions in each directory.

PRs are welcome :)
