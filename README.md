Sometimes we need to create our own containers or charts to have a more updated version, or because we prefer to deploy
it differently.

We will make some of this public available in case someone else want to save some hours of work, we provide everything as-is with not guarantee or responsibility for Vizlegal.

You can find `README's` with specific instructions in each directory.

PRs are welcome :)
